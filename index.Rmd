I am a self-directed learner in R, Tableau and SQL, living in the Shoalhaven Area of NSW. 
Currently I am looking for work as a data analyst. My interests include studying, statistics,
chess, and trying to pick the perfect round in NFL.

- Bachelor of Business Studies from Charles Sturt University (Completed 2021)
- Bachelor of Data Analytics from University of South Australia (Commencing 2022)

I love learning and using R and RStudio to wrangle, analyse, model, and visualise data.
In fact, this website was created using the distill package in R. RStudio has all the tools
I need to create RMarkdown files and push them through to GitHub. I am indebted to
Yury Zablotski for [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZt4H-ogH3s) on YouTube,
explaining how to create a blog using the distill package
and Assoc Prof Alison Hill for [this blog post](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2020-12-postcards-distill/)
showing how to integrate postcards with distill.
I am currently working my way through
*Statistics With R: Solving Problems Using Real-World Data*
by Jenine K. Harris. It is an excellent resource for learning both statistics
and how to use R. My main online resource for learning R is [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).
I also do courses on Linkedin Learning and at the moment I am watching
*R Essential Training: Wrangling and Visualizing Data* by Barton Poulson. I am a big fan of
Brandon Foltz [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFrjdcImgcQVyFbK04MBEhA) who
is great at explaining statistical concepts step-by-step.

The easiest way to contact me is probably via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mikejhudson).
My Twitter handle is @mikejhudson.
Take a look at my #auspol charts while you are there. I also made a post about
that project, if you would like to check it out on the Blog page of this site.

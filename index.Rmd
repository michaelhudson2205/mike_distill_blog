Hello and welcome to my blog.

I am an enthusiastic learner and user of R, Python, Power BI and Excel, living in the Western Plains of NSW. 

<!-- Currently, my spare time is taken up learning about time series analysis and forecasting using R, and I am also teaching myself to use Streamlit, an open source app framework in the Python language. -->

<!-- My personal interests include Japanese, chess, mathematics, reading and watching movies from the 1950s.  -->

- Bachelor of Business Studies at Charles Sturt University (Completed 2021)

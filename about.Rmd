I love learning and using R and RStudio to wrangle, analyse, model, and visualise data.
In fact, this website was created using the distill package in R. RStudio has all the tools
I need to create RMarkdown files and push them through to GitHub. I am indebted to
Yury Zablotski for [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZt4H-ogH3s) on YouTube,
explaining how to create a blog using the distill package
and Assoc Prof Alison Hill for [this blog post](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2020-12-postcards-distill/)
showing how to integrate postcards with distill.
My main online resource for learning R is [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), although recently I have been spending most of my "R time" on YouTube either watching the [Statistics Globe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyHEww8_SCdxZvEnkCfi55w) channel or
[R Programming 101](https://www.youtube.com/c/RProgramming101).
I am a big fan of Brandon Foltz [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFrjdcImgcQVyFbK04MBEhA) who is great at explaining statistical concepts step-by-step.

The easiest way to contact me is probably via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mikejhudson).
My Twitter handle is @mikejhudson.

I hope you find these posts interesting. If you'd like to, you can buy me a coffee.

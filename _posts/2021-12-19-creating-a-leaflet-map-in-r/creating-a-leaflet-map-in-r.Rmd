### To the project...

At a recent interview I had several questions about APIs, so I thought I would do a few projects that involve retrieving data from online applications' databases. API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.

In this project I set up an account with the [Google Maps Platform]("https://developers.google.com/maps"){target="_blank"} which then allowed me to serve up a list of street addresses and receive back their latitude and longitude coordinates. I needed these in order to place the markers on the leaflet map I was using for the visualisation. I started with an Excel spreadsheet as shown below:

```{r excel-image}
knitr::include_graphics("Excel_screenshot.png")
```

I saved that file as a .csv and then brought it into R to perform the following:

```{r r-code}
knitr::include_graphics("carbon.png")
```

The ggmap::geocode() returns the latitude and longitude for street addresses after accessing the Google Maps Platform API.

I did some more wrangling of the hasi_coords.csv file to produce the following:

```{r csv-image}
knitr::include_graphics("csv_screenshot.png")
```

Now, with the data ready, I proceeded to make the map.

```{r mapping-code, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)

hasi_coords <- read_csv("hasi_coords_A.csv")

hasi_coords$file <- as.character(hasi_coords$file)

Adam_data <- hasi_coords %>% 
  filter(Keyworker == "Adam")

Allen_data <- hasi_coords %>% 
  filter(Keyworker == "Allen")

Carrie_data <- hasi_coords %>% 
  filter(Keyworker == "Carrie")

Ebony_data <- hasi_coords %>% 
  filter(Keyworker == "Ebony")

Gordon_data <- hasi_coords %>% 
  filter(Keyworker == "Gordon")

Jen_data <- hasi_coords %>% 
  filter(Keyworker == "Jen")

Kalindi_data <- hasi_coords %>% 
  filter(Keyworker == "Kalindi")

KerryM_data <- hasi_coords %>% 
  filter(Keyworker == "KerryM")

Mike_data <- hasi_coords %>% 
  filter(Keyworker == "Mike")

    targetGroups = c("Adam","Allen","Carrie","Ebony","Gordon","Jen","Kalindi","KerryM","Mike"),
    options = searchFeaturesOptions(zoom = 20)
  ) %>%

  addLegend(position = "bottomright",
            pal = pal,
            values = c("Nowra","Ulladulla"))

### Wrap-up
This project took a lot of googling and reading stackoverflow posts to get leaflet behaving the way I wanted. It took me a while to work out that separate layers needed to be created for each Keyworker in order to get the overlayGroups control and the Seach function working properly, and I had quite a challenge to get the markers to display different colours according to which site the client belonged to. Also, labels don't behave the same way as popups so there was a lot of mucking around with getting this sorted. I'll list the websites and stackoverflow posts I found helpful below. If you've read this far, I thank you for your time and interest in looking at my blog. :-) Mike

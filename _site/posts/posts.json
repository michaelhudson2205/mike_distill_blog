In this exercise, a hand of poker consists of five cards drawn randomly without replacement from a single, well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. The total number of possible five card hands, drawn from a 52 card deck without replacement and given that order does not matter, is:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nTotal\\ number\\ of\\ possible\\ poker\\ hands = 52C5 & = \\frac{52!}{5! \\times 47!} \\\\\n\\\\\n& = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\times 48}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} \\\\\n\\\\\n& = 2,598,960\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nThe poker hands of interest are:\n\nRank\n\n\nName\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n1\n\n\nRoyal flush\n\n\nThe hand contains the A, K, Q, J and 10 of the same suit.\n\n\n2\n\n\nStraight flush\n\n\nThe hand contains five cards of the same suit with consecutive values.

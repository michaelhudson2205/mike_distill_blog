RStudio has all the tools I need to create RMarkdown files and push them through to GitHub. I am indebted to Yury Zablotski for this video on YouTube, explaining how to create a blog using the distill package and Assoc Prof Alison Hill for this blog post showing how to integrate postcards with distill. My main online resource for learning R is DataCamp, although recently I have been spending most of my “R time” watching the Statistics Globe channel on YouTube. I also do courses on Linkedin Learning and at the moment I am watching Python for Data Science Essential Training Part 1 by Lillian Pierson. I am a big fan of Brandon Foltz on YouTube who is great at explaining statistical concepts step-by-step.\nThe easiest way to contact me is probably via Twitter. My Twitter handle is @mikejhudson.\nI hope you find these posts interesting. If you’d like to, you can buy me a coffee.\nThis page last updated: 2022-02-06\n\n\n\n",

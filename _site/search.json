RStudio has all the tools\nI need to create RMarkdown files and push them through to GitHub. I am indebted to\nYury Zablotski for this video on YouTube,\nexplaining how to create a blog using the distill package\nand Assoc Prof Alison Hill for this blog post\nshowing how to integrate postcards with distill.\nMy main online resource for learning R is DataCamp, although recently I have been spending most of my “R time” on YouTube either watching the Statistics Globe channel or\nR Programming 101.\nI am a big fan of Brandon Foltz on YouTube who is great at explaining statistical concepts step-by-step.\nThe easiest way to contact me is probably via Twitter.\nMy Twitter handle is @mikejhudson.\nI hope you find these posts interesting. If you’d like to, you can buy me a coffee.\nThis page last updated: 2022-09-15\n\n\n\n",
